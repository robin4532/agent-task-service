# Agent Task Service

This project is a lightweight backend service designed as a first step
toward building agent-oriented AI systems.

The goal is to explore how tasks can be assigned, tracked, and retrieved
by agents through a simple API, forming a foundation for future
AI-powered workflows.

# Motivation for this project 

Modern AI systems are increasingly built around agents, orchestration,
and scalable inference rather than standalone models.

As a beginner entering this space, I wanted to start with the systems
layer that supports AI agents in real-world environments.

# What This Project Does

- Defines a simple "agent" abstraction
- Allows tasks to be assigned to agents
- Exposes API endpoints to retrieve agent tasks
- Designed to be extended toward AI-driven execution

# Tech Stack

- Python
- FastAPI
- SQLite (local storage)

# Current Status

This is an early prototype built under time constraints to demonstrate
intent, direction, and hands-on initiative.

# Future Work

- Integrate LLM-based agents
- Add authentication and persistence
- Prepare for cloud-native deployment
- Explore inference-optimized infrastructure

# Why I Built This

I am at an early stage in my programming journey, but I am intentionally
focusing on backend systems for AI applications rather than isolated
model training.
